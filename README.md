# media-classifier
Classifying downloaded media files with sparse information

I am an amateur programmer working on simple projects to improve my backend developer skills. Although my professional experience is in financial services and my future aspirations are more aligned in healthcare, software development is a lifelong hobby of mine.

This media classification project will use both rules based and machine learning technique to organize media files that do not have standard file libraries. 

The source of motivation is coming from a desire to help people that are experiencing a similar problem, and also just a way to prototype through a number of techniques and technologies that are available.
